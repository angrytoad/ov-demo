### Task

A commercial building in the UK (Stark Industries UK HQ) consumes electricity from the National Grid. Write a programme in a language of your choice that calculates

- The monthly energy consumed by the building (kWh)
- The monthly amount of CO2 (kgs) emitted by the electricity generated for
  the building. Use half hourly readings from data sources to calculate this
- The monthly % of fuel mix (wind/solar/nuclear/coal/etc) used to generate the electricity. Again, use half hourly readings to calculate weighted average
