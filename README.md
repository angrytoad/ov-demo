A commercial building in the UK (Stark Industries UK HQ) consumes electricity from the National Grid. Write a programme in a language of your choice that calculates 

The monthly energy consumed by the building (kWh)
The monthly amount of CO2 (kgs) emitted by the electricity generated for the building. Use half hourly readings from data sources to calculate this
The monthly % of fuel mix (wind/solar/nuclear/coal/etc) used to generate the electricity. Again, use half hourly readings to calculate weighted average

The timeframe is for the month of January 2023
